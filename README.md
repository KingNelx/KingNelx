💻 I’m a dev who loves turning ideas into real-world solutions—whether it’s backend, frontend, or full-stack, I’m always coding, building, and learning. Ranked #63 in the Philippines on GitHub, but when I’m not pushing commits, I’m pushing towers in Dota 2 (Immortal, btw 🏆). Clean code, meaningful projects, and a little bit of gaming fuel my grind both in tech and in-game.
