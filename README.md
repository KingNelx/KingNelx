My name is Jonel P Tapia, 4th yr College student from Catanduanes State University. 
        I've been learning to code since last 2019, I know to myself that I'm not that good enough. I am very passionate about programming even though I know it is complicated sometimes. I am willing to take hard challenges just to improve myself.
    
    
Here are some ideas to get you started:


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Java/Spring Boot
- Mysql
- PHP
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
